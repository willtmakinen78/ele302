# ELE 302 Carlab Project
My Junior year design project for ELE302 Carlab

This desgin project was a culmination of a semester's worth of work to build the control electronics for an RC car from scratch. The first part of the semester was used to develop the speed control (using PID and an IR encoder to make the car drive at a constant speed on a flat, uphill, and downhill surface) and line-following (using a canera and PID to control the servo to steer the car and follow a plack line on a white surface). The second part was more open-ended, so my partner Ryan Thorpe and I decided to build a sentry gun/turret vehicle. It was originally supposed to drive aroud the track and look for ballons, however unfortunately the PixyCam as unable to pick them up bery well due to the glare from the lights. Instead, we had it track colored folders, whos matte color made it much easier to track and shoot down using the dart turret. The files here are failry hard to follow due to the combination of PSoC and Python files, so follow this link for a narrated video showing the final result in action and explaing its operation:
